## How to run locally

### Database requirements
Featmap runs on top of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), so make sure you have it running on your system. At this step, make sure to setup the credentials and database that Featmap will use.


### Downloading
[Download](https://github.com/amborle/featmap/releases) the Featmap binary for your respective platform and save it somewhere on your system. 

### Configuration
In the directory where you placed the binary, create a file called ```conf.json```.

Here's a sample  ```conf.json```

```json
{  
  "appSiteURL": "http://localhost/",
  "dbConnectionString": "postgresql://featmap:featmap@localhost:5432/featmap?sslmode=disable",
  "jwtSecret": "ChangeMeForProduction",
  "port": "80",
  "emailFrom" : "contact@example.com",
  "smtpServer" : "smtp.example.com",
  "smtpPort": "587",
  "smtpUser" : "postmaster@mail.example.com",
  "smtpPass": "some_smtp_password",
  "environment": "development"  
}
```

Setting | Description
--- | --- 
`appSiteURL` | The url to where you will be hosting the app.
`dbConnectionString` | The connection string to the PostgreSQL database that Featmap should connect to.
`jwtSecret` | This setting is used to secure the cookies produced by Featmap. Generate a random string and keep it safe! 
`port` | The port that Featmap should run on.
`emailFrom` | The email adress that should be used as sender when sending invitation and password reset mails.
`smtpServer` | SMTP server for sending emails.
`smtpPort` | **Optional** Will default to port 587 if not specified. 
`smtpUser` | SMTP server username.
`smtpPass` | SMTP server password.
`environment` |  **Optional** If set to `development`, the backend will not serve secure cookies.

### Running
Execute the binary.

```bash
./featmap-1.0.0-linux-amd64
Serving on port 80
```

Open a browser to http://localhost and you are ready to go! If Featmap is not running on port 80, use http://localhost:port.

## Building

### Requirements
The following must be installed on your system in order to build
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Go](https://golang.org/)
* [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata)

### Instructions
Start by cloning the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amborle/featmap.git
```

Navigate to the repository.

```bash
cd featmap
```

Now let's build it (requires Bash).

```bash
./build/complete_build.sh
```

Binaries for Linux, Win and Mac are now available in the ```bin``` folder.

```bash
cd bin
ls
featmap-1.0.3-darwin-amd64  featmap-1.0.3-linux-amd64  featmap-1.0.3-windows-amd64.exe
```

## Running with `docker-compose`

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amborle/featmap.git
```

Navigate to the repository.

```bash
cd featmap
```

Now let's build it (requires Bash).

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Create a `.env` file, and edit any defaults

```bash
cp config/env.sample .env
```

Create a configuration file by copying `config/conf.sample.json`, and make any appropriate changes from the env file for the database connection string

```bash
cp config/conf.sample.json config/conf.json
```

Startup the services, the app should now be available on the port you defined in your .env file. (Default: 8080)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
